# Basic_banking
I have created  a Basic banking website in which we can transfer money from one customers account to another customers account. I have used HTML,CSS for frontend, for backend- PHP and for database-MySQL .There is a home page and about our team members and there are three more pages for customer details, transaction of money and to show the history of transaction.
